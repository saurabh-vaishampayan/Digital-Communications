This contains latex report and code for assignment 2 for Digital communications. 
It involved implementation of Viterbi algorithm, Decision feedback Equalisation and Linear equalisation, for decoding
a random noisy sequence(4-PAM alphabet), and analysis on symbol error rate, noise and structure of algorithm from obtained results
