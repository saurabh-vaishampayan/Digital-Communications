This folder contains codes and report for assignment 1. Topics dealt with include: Transmission of symbol sequences using Nyquist pulse shaping, timing errors.
Then we perform Monte Carlo simulations for various 2d signal constellations for error rates, compare with theoretical exact and bound-approximate error rates.
We compare bit error rates with and without Gray coding and draw inferences for the section results in the assignment
